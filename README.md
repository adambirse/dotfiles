# dotfiles

My first attempt at entering the magical world of automating my dotfiles. Starting small and will see how sophisticated things become.

`git clone git@github.com:adambirse/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles`



## Usage

run `./install.sh`to install everything

or

run `./install.sh brew` to run brew
